# Wave 4 Observability Summary

## Overview
Wave 4 implements comprehensive observability enhancements across HTTP and WebSocket gateways, including structured JSONL logging and expanded metrics.

## Completed Tasks

### T5040: HTTP JSONL Logging ✅
**Objective**: Create structured HTTP logging with integrity metadata

**Implementation**:
- Created structured logging to `reports/gateway-http.log.jsonl`
- Auto-initialized logging on startup (no env var required)
- Includes all required fields:
  - `ts`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `ip`: Client IP address
  - `method`: HTTP method
  - `path`: Request path
  - `bytes`: Request body size
  - `mode`: Upload mode (async/sync)
  - `ruleId`: Matched DSL rule ID
  - `status`: HTTP status code
  - `durMs`: Duration in milliseconds
  - `rateMBps`: Transfer rate for uploads
  - `error`: Error code if failed
- **T5013 Integration**: Includes integrity fields from multipart uploads:
  - `sha256`: File hash
  - `mime`: MIME type
  - `size`: File size

**Files Modified**:
- `src/connectors/http.ts`: Added structured logging interface, auto-init, integrity field logging

**Example Log Entry**:
```json
{"ts":"2025-10-19T14:23:46.789Z","ip":"127.0.0.1","method":"POST","path":"/v1/upload","bytes":104857600,"mode":"async","ruleId":"multipart_upload","status":200,"durMs":1234,"rateMBps":85.3,"sha256":"a3b2c1...","mime":"image/png","size":104857600}
```

### T5041: WebSocket JSONL Logging ✅
**Objective**: Create structured WebSocket logging with lifecycle tracking

**Implementation**:
- Created structured logging to `reports/gateway-ws.log.jsonl`

- Includes all required fields:
  - `ts`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `connId`: Unique connection identifier
  - `ip`: Client IP address
  - `stream`: Stream name
  - `credit`: Credit granted by client

### T5042: Metrics Expansion ✅
**Objective**: Expand /v1/metrics endpoint with counters and histograms

**Implementation**:

#### HTTP Metrics:
- **Counters**:
  - `requestsTotal`: Total HTTP requests
  - `bytesIn`: Total bytes received
  - `bytesOut`: Total bytes sent
  - `uploadCount`: Total uploads
  - `uploadBytesTotal`: Total upload bytes
- **By-dimension tracking**:
  - `requestsByPath`: Request count per endpoint
  - `requestsByStatus`: Request count per status code
  - `ruleHits`: DSL rule invocation count
- **Histograms**:
  - Duration percentiles: p50, p95, p99
  - Last 1000 requests tracked for accurate histograms

#### WebSocket Metrics:
- **Counters**:
  - `connectionsTotal`: Total connections ever
  - `activeConnections`: Current active connections
  - `messagesIn`: Total messages received
  - `messagesOut`: Total messages sent (deliveries)
  - `creditsGranted`: Total credit granted
  - `deliveriesTotal`: Total deliveries
  - `errorsTotal`: Total errors
- **By-dimension tracking**:
  - `errorsByType`: Error count by error type

**Integration**:
- Combined backend metrics with HTTP/WS metrics in single endpoint
- WS metrics updated every 1 second via `setInterval`
- HTTP metrics recorded on every request completion

**Files Modified**:
- `src/connectors/http.ts`: Added metrics collection, recording, histogram calculation
- `src/connectors/ws.ts`: Added metrics tracking to all lifecycle events
- `src/index.ts`: Wired up WS metrics to HTTP metrics endpoint

**Example Metrics Response**:
```json
{
  "streams": [...],
  "http": {
    "requestsTotal": 1234,
    "bytesIn": 104857600,
    "bytesOut": 524288,
    "requestsByPath": {
      "/v1/upload": 100,
      "/v1/enqueue": 500,
      "/v1/stats": 634
    },
    "requestsByStatus": {
      "200": 1100,
      "400": 50,
      "500": 84
    },
    "ruleHits": {
      "multipart_upload": 100,
      "enqueue_rule": 500
    },
    "durations": {
      "p50": 45,
      "p95": 250,
      "p99": 1200,
      "count": 1000
    },
    "uploads": {
      "count": 100,
      "bytesTotal": 104857600
    }
  },
  "ws": {
    "connectionsTotal": 50,
    "activeConnections": 12,
    "messagesIn": 5000,
    "messagesOut": 4500,
    "creditsGranted": 10000,
    "deliveriesTotal": 4500,
    "errorsTotal": 15,
    "errorsByType": {
      "RateLimitExceeded": 10,
      "InvalidJSON": 5
    }
  }
}

## Documentation

### Updated Files:
1. **docs/OBSERVABILITY.md**:
   - Updated HTTP log format table with new fields
   - Changed from event-based to structured format
   - Added WebSocket logging section with full examples
   - Added expanded metrics endpoint documentation
   - Added analysis examples with jq queries

2. **README.md**:
   - Updated observability section
   - Documented automatic JSONL logging
   - Listed all new metric types

---

## Verification

### Compilation:
```bash
npm run test:compile
# ✅ PASSED
```

### Metrics Endpoint:
```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9087/v1/metrics | jq
# Returns combined backend + HTTP + WS metrics
```

### Log Files:
- `reports/gateway-http.log.jsonl` - Created automatically on first HTTP request
- `reports/gateway-ws.log.jsonl` - Created automatically on first WS connection
- Both use WriteStream for performance
- Both auto-create reports/ directory if missing

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Auto-initialization**: Logging now enabled by default to `reports/*.jsonl`, no env var needed
2. **Structured logging**: Removed generic `event` field, all fields are now strongly typed
3. **Performance**: Use WriteStream instead of appendFileSync for better throughput
4. **Metrics integration**: Single `/v1/metrics` endpoint for all metrics (backend, HTTP, WS)
5. **Histogram accuracy**: Track last 1000 durations for percentile calculation
6. **Zero dependencies**: All metric calculation done in-memory, no external libraries

---

## Analysis Examples

### HTTP Log Analysis:
```bash
# Find slow requests (>1s)
cat reports/gateway-http.log.jsonl | jq 'select(.durMs > 1000)'

# Calculate average upload rate
cat reports/gateway-http.log.jsonl | jq -s '[.[] | select(.rateMBps) | .rateMBps] | add / length'

# Count requests by status
cat reports/gateway-http.log.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.status) | map({status: .[0].status, count: length})'

# Find uploads with integrity metadata
cat reports/gateway-http.log.jsonl | jq 'select(.sha256)'
```

### WebSocket Log Analysis:
```bash
# Track connection lifecycle
CONN_ID="ws-1729350000000-1"
cat reports/gateway-ws.log.jsonl | jq --arg id "$CONN_ID" 'select(.connId == $id)'

# Calculate average connection duration
cat reports/gateway-ws.log.jsonl | jq -s '[.[] | select(.durMs) | .durMs] | add / length'

# Find rate limit errors
cat reports/gateway-ws.log.jsonl | jq 'select(.error | contains("RateLimit"))'

# Count total deliveries
cat reports/gateway-ws.log.jsonl | jq -s '[.[] | select(.delivers) | .delivers] | add'
```

### Metrics Queries:
```bash
# Get HTTP request count
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9087/v1/metrics | jq '.http.requestsTotal'

# Get p95 latency
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9087/v1/metrics | jq '.http.durations.p95'

# Get active WebSocket connections
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9087/v1/metrics | jq '.ws.activeConnections'

# Monitor in real-time
watch -n 1 'curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9087/v1/metrics | jq'
```

## Benefits

1. **Agent-friendly**: JSONL format is parseable by agents without human intervention
2. **Integrity tracking**: SHA256 hashes logged for audit and verification
3. **Complete lifecycle**: Every WS connection tracked from connect to close
4. **Performance insights**: Histograms show latency distribution, not just averages
5. **Rule effectiveness**: Track which DSL rules are used most
6. **Capacity planning**: Active connections, bytes, rates inform scaling decisions
7. **Error patterns**: Error-by-type metrics identify systematic issues
