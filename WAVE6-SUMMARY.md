# Get metrics
curl http://localhost:9087/v1/metrics | jq .

# Reload config (zero-downtime)
kill -HUP $(pgrep -f "node dist/index.js")

# Analyze logs
jq 'select(.status >= 500)' reports/gateway-http.log.jsonl | tail -20
```

## Recommendations

### For Development Teams
1. Run `npm run test:load-uploads` and `npm run test:load-ws` before major releases
2. Use `npm run test:soak` for pre-production validation (15+ minutes)
3. Monitor memory growth trends in soak test reports
4. Address any memory stability warnings before production deployment

### For SRE Teams
1. Bookmark `docs/SRE-RUNBOOK.md` for operational reference
2. Set up alerts based on runbook thresholds (5xx errors >1%, memory growth, etc.)
3. Use load tests to validate infrastructure changes
4. Practice incident response procedures during staging deployments
5. Integrate `/v1/metrics` endpoint with monitoring dashboards (Grafana, Datadog)

### For Performance Analysis
1. Establish baseline metrics from load tests in staging environment
2. Compare production metrics against baseline using load test reports
3. Use soak test memory analysis to detect regressions
4. Track p95/p99 latency trends over time
