## T5090: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Exploration

**Document:** [docs/rfcs/T5090-HTTP2-HTTP3-EXPLORATION.md](docs/rfcs/T5090-HTTP2-HTTP3-EXPLORATION.md)

### Key Findings

**HTTP/2:**
- ✅ **Production-ready** via Node.js `http2` module (stable since Node 10)
- 10-30% latency reduction for concurrent requests
- 20-40% bandwidth savings from header compression (HPACK)
- Single TCP connection eliminates head-of-line blocking at HTTP layer
- ALPN negotiation enables graceful fallback to HTTP/1.1

**HTTP/3:**
- ⚠️ **Experimental** - ecosystem not yet mature
- Built on QUIC (UDP transport) with 0-RTT resumption
- 10-20% latency improvement on lossy networks
- Connection migration benefits mobile/roaming clients
- Limited Node.js support (`@fails-components/webtransport` at 0.x)

### Recommendations

**Immediate (v1.2 - Q4 2025):**
1. Implement HTTP/2 support on separate port (9090)
2. Enable ALPN fallback to HTTP/1.1
3. Benchmark and document performance improvements
4. Update client libraries and examples

**Future (v2.0 - 2026 Q2+):**
1. Monitor HTTP/3 ecosystem maturity
2. Prototype with `@fails-components/webtransport`
3. Pilot deployment with opt-in flag
4. Deprecate HTTP/1.1 after HTTP/2 proven stable

### Performance Projections

| Protocol   | 10 Concurrent Requests | 100 Concurrent | Lossy Network |
|------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| HTTP/1.1   | 150ms                  | 500ms          | 200ms         |
| HTTP/2     | 80ms (47% faster)      | 150ms (70% faster) | 180ms     |
| HTTP/3     | 70ms (53% faster)      | 120ms (76% faster) | 100ms (50% faster) |

### Implementation Effort

- **HTTP/2:** 4-6 weeks (ready for v1.2)
- **HTTP/3:** 12-16 weeks (deferred to v2.0)

## T5091: Resumable/Chunked Uploads Design

**Document:** [docs/rfcs/GATEWAY-HTTP-UX.md](docs/rfcs/GATEWAY-HTTP-UX.md#13-resumablechunked-uploads-t5091---design) (Section 13)

### Problem Statement

Current `/v1/upload` requires full file transmission in single request, causing:
- Network interruptions force full restart
- Timeout risks for large files (>1GB)
- Poor UX on mobile/unstable networks
- No progress tracking or pause/resume

### Protocol Design

**Four-phase protocol:**
1. **Initiate:** `POST /v1/upload/initiate` → returns `uploadId`, `totalChunks`, expiry
2. **Upload Chunks:** `PUT /v1/upload/{uploadId}/chunk/{index}` with `Content-Range` header
3. **Query Status:** `GET /v1/upload/{uploadId}/status` → returns received/missing chunks
4. **Finalize:** `POST /v1/upload/{uploadId}/finalize` → assembles chunks, returns `blobRef`

### Key Features

**Failure Recovery:**
- Client queries status after interruption
- Server tracks received chunks (in-memory or Redis)
- Resume from last successful chunk
- Chunk-level SHA256 validation

**Server-Side:**
- Temporary chunk storage: `/tmp/uploads/{uploadId}/chunk-{index}.bin`
- 24-hour expiration (configurable)
- Finalization concatenates chunks, validates SHA256
- Integration with blob backends (S3/MinIO/local)

**Security:**
- Per-user/tenant session limits (10 concurrent)
- Rate limiting on initiation (10/min per IP)
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- `uploadId` tied to authenticated user

### Integration with Blob System

Finalized uploads integrate with T5010/T5011 blob system:
- Chunks assembled into final blob
- Stored in configured backend (S3/MinIO/local)
- Returns `blobRef` with integrity metadata
- Optional DSL rule auto-enqueues on completion

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Core Protocol (4 weeks)**
- Implement 4 endpoints (initiate, chunk, status, finalize)
- In-memory session tracking
- File-based chunk storage

**Phase 2: Resilience (2 weeks)**
- Redis-backed session tracking (multi-server)
- SHA256 validation per chunk
- Expiration and cleanup

**Phase 3: Integration (2 weeks)**
- Blob backend integration
- DSL rules for auto-enqueue
- Observability (logs, metrics)

**Phase 4: Client Libraries (4 weeks)**
- JavaScript/TypeScript client
- Python client
- CLI tool with automatic retry

**Total Effort:** 12 weeks (3 months)

### Performance Projections

**Benefits:**
- 1GB file: ~1s overhead (200 chunks × 5ms) - negligible
- Bandwidth savings: Resume from last chunk (not full restart)
- Better UX: Progress tracking, pause/resume

**Costs:**
- Temporary storage: ~50MB per upload (10 concurrent = 500MB)
- Session metadata: ~1KB per upload (scales to millions in Redis)

## T5092: CBOR & MessagePack Codec Exploration

**Document:** [docs/rfcs/PROTO-DSL-v0.md](docs/rfcs/PROTO-DSL-v0.md#14a-cbor--messagepack-codec-option-t5092---design-exploration) (Section 14a)

### Problem Statement

JSONL (newline-delimited JSON) has performance and size drawbacks:
- 30-50% size overhead vs binary formats
- Text parsing slower than binary deserialization
- Floating-point precision loss (numbers as strings)
- Critical for bandwidth-constrained networks (serial, BLE, LoRa)

### Codec Comparison

| Metric          | JSONL (baseline) | CBOR       | MessagePack |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Size**        | 1.0x             | 0.5-0.7x   | 0.6-0.8x    |
| **Parse Speed** | 1.0x             | 2-3x faster | 2-4x faster |
| **Human Readable** | ✅ Yes        | ❌ Binary  | ❌ Binary   |
| **Standard**    | Universal        | IETF RFC 8949 | De facto |
| **Node.js Lib** | Built-in         | `cbor` (2M+ weekly) | `@msgpack/msgpack` |

**Recommendation:** CBOR for standards compliance, MessagePack for Redis/existing systems

### Use Cases

**Serial/BLE/LoRa (Low Bandwidth):**
- 9600 baud: CBOR = 2x throughput vs JSONL
- BLE (20 bytes/packet): CBOR enables larger control messages

**High-Throughput Agents:**
- 10,000 frames/sec: 70% CPU reduction (CBOR vs JSONL)

**Numeric Precision:**
- Sensor data: CBOR preserves full IEEE 754 floats
- JSONL: `{"temp": 98.6}` → string → parsing loss

### Design: Opt-In Codec Selection

**DSL Configuration:**
```yaml
version: "proto-dsl/v0"

bind:
  http:   { port: 9087 }
  serial: { device: /dev/ttyUSB0, baud: 9600 }

codec:
  http:   { in: jsonl, out: jsonl }    # Default: human-readable
  serial: { in: cbor, out: cbor }      # Opt-in: bandwidth-constrained
```

**Per-Transport Codec:**
- Each binding specifies `in` (client→server) and `out` (server→client)
- Codec applies to control frames only (not HTTP body payloads)
- HTTP/WS default to JSONL (debuggability)
- Serial/BLE/LoRa default to CBOR (performance)

### Implementation Approach

**Codec Abstraction:**
```typescript
interface Codec {
  encode(frame: any): Buffer;
  decode(buffer: Buffer): any;
}

class JSONLCodec implements Codec { ... }
class CBORCodec implements Codec { ... }
class MessagePackCodec implements Codec { ... }
```

**Registry Pattern:**
- Centralized codec registry
- Per-binding codec selection from DSL
- Zero impact on Core (always speaks JSONL internally)
- Conduit translates at edge: `Client CBOR ↔ Conduit ↔ Core JSONL`

### Impact on DSL and Protocol

**DSL Changes:**
- Add `codec` top-level block
- Per-binding `in`/`out` codec selection
- Backward compatible (defaults to `jsonl`)

**Protocol Impact:**
- Frame semantics unchanged (same types, fields)
- Wire format differs (JSON text vs binary)
- Both parties negotiate codec via DSL config

**Migration:**
- Core remains JSONL (no changes)
- Opt-in per binding (low-risk serial/BLE first)
- HTTP/WS keep JSONL default for debugging

### Performance Projections

**Size Reduction:**
- Typical enqueue frame (100-byte payload):
  - JSONL: 150 bytes
  - CBOR: 95 bytes (37% reduction)
  - MessagePack: 98 bytes (35% reduction)

**Throughput:**
- 9600 baud serial:
  - JSONL: ~60 frames/sec
  - CBOR: ~95 frames/sec (58% increase)

**CPU:**
- Parsing 10,000 frames:
  - JSONL: 180ms
  - CBOR: 55ms (69% reduction)
  - MessagePack: 50ms (72% reduction)

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Library Integration (2 weeks)**
- Add `cbor`, `@msgpack/msgpack` dependencies
- Implement codec abstraction and registry
- Unit tests for encode/decode

**Phase 2: DSL Integration (2 weeks)**
- Parse `codec` block from rules.yaml
- Apply to serial/FS bindings
- Integration tests with CBOR/MessagePack clients

**Phase 3: Validation & Benchmarking (1 week)**
- Interop tests (Python/Rust CBOR clients)
- Performance benchmarks vs JSONL

**Phase 4: Documentation & Release (2 weeks)**
- Update PROTO-DSL-v0.md
- Release as experimental (v1.2)
- Production-ready after field testing (v1.3)

**Total Effort:** 7 weeks (1.75 months)

### Recommendations

**Immediate (v1.2):**
- Implement CBOR for Serial/BLE bindings
- Keep JSONL default for HTTP/WS
- Add codec abstraction layer

**Future (v1.3+):**
- Add MessagePack for Redis/queue integrations
- Codec negotiation (Content-Type, WebSocket subprotocol)
- Extend to HTTP/WS as opt-in for high-throughput

## Conclusion

Wave 8 explorations successfully researched and documented three high-impact enhancements:

1. **HTTP/2:** Production-ready performance upgrade for v1.2 (4-6 weeks)
2. **Resumable Uploads:** Robust large-file transfers for v1.3 (12 weeks)
3. **CBOR Codec:** Bandwidth-efficient transports for serial/BLE in v1.2-v1.3 (7 weeks)

All explorations include detailed implementation plans, performance projections, and risk assessments. Recommendations align with incremental delivery philosophy: ship HTTP/2 quickly (stable technology), validate CBOR experimentally, and build resumable uploads in phases.

**Total estimated effort:** 23 weeks for all features (can be parallelized across team).
